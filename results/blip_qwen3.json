        "answer": "unknown",
        "common_pattern": "Error",
        "sentence": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the common pattern among the positive sentences. Let's look at them:\n\n1. \"a woman feeding a dolphin in a pool\"\n2. \"a woman is in a pool with a dolphin\"\n3. \"a dolphin swimming in a pool\"\n4. \"two dolphins with red and white hats in the pool\"\n5. \"dolphin swimming in the pool at the aquarium in the city of stockholm, sweden\"\n6. \"people watching dolphins in an aquarium at the zoo and aquarium in the ocean park of los, california - stock\"\n\nHmm, all these sentences involve dolphins and a pool or aquarium. The main elements are dolphins, pools, aquariums, and sometimes people interacting with them. The negative examples are:\n\n1. \"a cat playing in the pool with a ra cat\" \u2013 mentions a cat, not a dolphin.\n2. \"a little girl in a swimming pool in a pink bikini\" \u2013 just a person in a pool, no dolphin.\n3. \"a group of people watching seals in a tank\" \u2013 seals instead of dolphins.\n4. \"dolphins swimming in a pool with a man at the background\" \u2013 dolphins and a man, but maybe the man is just in the background, not interacting directly?\n5. \"dolphins swimming in an aquarium\" \u2013 seems similar to positive 5, but maybe the absence of people?\n6. \"a penguin in an aquarium looking at a dolphin\" \u2013 penguin is another animal, so not the focus.\n\nThe pattern in the positive examples seems to be the presence of dolphins in a pool or aquarium, possibly with people interacting with them. The negative examples either have different animals (cats, seals, penguins) or lack direct interaction. \n\nNow, looking at the query: \"a woman holding an object in front of a dolphin\". There's a woman and a dolphin. The dolphin is the main subject. The action is holding an object in front of it, which could be feeding or interacting. The location isn't specified as a pool or aquarium, but maybe that's not required if the interaction is clear. However, in the positive examples, the location is often specified (pool, aquarium). Wait, the first positive example is \"feeding a dolphin in a pool\", which includes both interaction and location. The query doesn't mention a pool or aquarium. But the negative example \"dolphins swimming in an aquarium\" is negative, so maybe just being in the location isn't enough. The positive examples often have people interacting with dolphins in those locations. \n\nThe query has a woman with a dolphin, holding an object. It's similar to positive 1 and 2 where a woman is feeding/with a dolphin. However, does the query specify the location? The positive examples often include \"pool\" or \"aquarium\". The query doesn't mention a pool or aquarium. But maybe the key is the interaction between a person and a dolphin. The negative example 4 has dolphins in a pool with a man in the background. The reason it's negative might be that the man is just in the background, not interacting. The query's woman is holding an object in front of the dolphin, which suggests interaction. However, if the location isn't specified, maybe that's a problem. \n\nBut looking at positive example 5: \"dolphin swimming in the pool at the aquarium...\" and positive example 6: \"people watching dolphins in an aquarium...\". So some positive examples have the location specified, others like positive 3 (\"a dolphin swimming in a pool\") don't mention the aquarium. So location isn't the only factor. The core is the presence of dolphins and interaction with people. \n\nThe query is a woman holding an object in front of a dolphin. That's direct interaction. So maybe it's positive. However, the negative example 4 is \"dolphins swimming in a pool with a man at the background\" which is negative. The difference is that in the query, the woman is actively holding an object in front of the dolphin, which is more direct interaction than someone being in the background. \n\nTherefore, the query likely fits the positive pattern because it involves a person interacting with a dolphin. The pattern is \"sentences that involve a person (woman, people) interacting with a dolphin in a pool or aquarium setting.\" The query doesn't mention the location, but the interaction is present. However, maybe the location is part of the pattern. Wait, in the positive examples, 3 and 4 don't mention the aquarium. Positive 3 is \"a dolphin swimming in a pool\", no people. Wait, but positive 3 is in the pool. So maybe the pattern is about the presence of dolphins and a location (pool or aquarium), and possibly people (but some positives have just dolphins). \n\nWait, this complicates things. Positive 3 is \"a dolphin swimming in a pool\" \u2013 no person, but it's still positive. So the pattern isn't necessarily people interacting. Then what's the common thread? Let me re-examine.\n\nLooking again at all positives:\n- They all have dolphins.\n- The location is a pool or aquarium (explicitly mentioned in most).\n- Some have people interacting, others just dolphins in those locations.\n\nNegative examples with dolphins in pools/aquariums:\n- \"dolphins swimming in an aquarium\" is negative. So just being in an aquarium isn't enough. Why is that negative? Maybe because there's no people involved. Positive 5 and 6 have people (people watching). Positive 3 is a dolphin in a pool, but no people. So maybe the presence of people is not required. Then why is negative 4 (\"dolphins swimming in a pool with a man at the background\") negative? Because the man is in the background, not interacting? \n\nSo the pattern might be that the positive examples involve dolphins in a pool or aquarium, possibly with people present (interacting or just present). The negative examples either have different animals or lack both people and specific dolphin interactions. \n\nBut positive 3 is a dolphin in a pool without people. So the presence of people isn't mandatory. Then the core pattern is: \"Dolphins in a pool or aquarium setting.\" But negative 4 is \"dolphins in a pool with a man in the background\" \u2013 so it's a dolphin in a pool, but it's negative. So that can't be. \n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that the positive examples involve dolphins and people in the same location (pool or aquarium). For example, \"a woman in a pool with a dolphin\", \"people watching dolphins in an aquarium\". Positive 3 is a dolphin in a pool alone, but maybe that's an exception. Or maybe the presence of people is part of the pattern. However, positive 3 is part of the positives. So maybe the pattern is not strictly people and dolphins together. \n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for keywords. All positives have \"dolphin\" (plural in some cases) and \"pool\" or \"aquarium\". The negatives either lack \"dolphin\" or the location. The query has a dolphin and a woman. The location isn't specified. So maybe the pattern is the presence of both dolphins and a pool/aquarium. \n\nWait, positive 3: \"a dolphin swimming in a pool\" \u2013 yes, pool. Positive 1 and 2 have pool. Positive 5 has \"pool at the aquarium\". Positive 6 has \"aquarium\". So all positive examples include either pool or aquarium. The query doesn't mention a pool or aquarium. So maybe the pattern is \"dolphins in a pool or aquarium\". Then the negatives that have dolphins in a pool or aquarium but without people would be negative? But positive 3 is a dolphin in a pool and is positive. Negative example 4 is \"dolphins in a pool with a man in background\" \u2013 so dolphins in pool, but it's negative. So that can't be the case. \n\nThis is confusing. Perhaps the pattern is the presence of dolphins and people in the same location (pool or aquarium). Then positive examples where both are present are positive. For example, positive 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 involve people and dolphins in those locations. Positive 3 is a dolphin in a pool but no people, yet it's still positive. So that breaks the pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is \"dolphins in a controlled environment (pool or aquarium)\". Negative examples like \"dolphins swimming in an aquarium\" are negative because they don't include people. But why is positive 5 and 6 positive? They have people watching. Positive 3 is a dolphin in a pool alone. So maybe the pattern is \"dolphins in a pool or aquarium, with or without people\". But then why are some negatives like \"dolphins swimming in an aquarium\" considered negative? That's part of the data. \n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not just the location. Let me think again. The positive examples include both dolphins in pools/aquariums with people and without. The negatives include dolphins in pools/aquariums but maybe without a clear interaction. Wait, maybe the key is that the positive examples have a more active interaction. For example, \"feeding\", \"with\", \"swimming with\", \"watching\". But the negative examples might have dolphins in the location but without that active interaction. \n\nThe query is \"a woman holding an object in front of a dolphin\". This seems like an interaction. If the pattern is active interaction between people and dolphins in a pool/aquarium, then the query would be positive. However, the location isn't specified. So maybe the location is part of the pattern. \n\nBut positive 3 is \"a dolphin swimming in a pool\" without people and it's positive. So location is part of the pattern. The pattern is \"dolphins in a pool or aquarium, with or without people interacting\". But then, why is \"dolphins swimming in an aquarium\" a negative example? That's conflicting. \n\nWait, looking back at the negative examples:\n\nNegative 4: \"dolphins swimming in a pool with a man at the background\" \u2013 this is in a pool, has a man, but is negative. The positive examples have people interacting with dolphins. So maybe the key is the interaction between people and dolphins in the location. \n\nSo the pattern is \"presence of dolphins in a pool or aquarium, and people interacting with them\". Positive examples where people are interacting are positive, and those where there are no people (like positive 3) might be exceptions. But positive 3 is part of the positives. So this is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the sentence mentions both dolphins and a specific location (pool or aquarium), regardless of people. Then why are some negatives with dolphins and location considered negative? For example, negative 4 is in a pool, but the man is in the background. Wait, but the pattern would include all sentences with dolphins and pool/aquarium. But the negative examples include some that do have dolphins in the location. \n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not that. Perhaps the pattern is \"dolphins in a controlled environment (pool or aquarium) with people present\". Positive examples where people are present and dolphins in the location are positive. But positive 3 is a dolphin in a pool without people and is positive. So that breaks it. \n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is simply that the sentence contains both \"dolphin\" and \"pool\" or \"aquarium\". Let's check:\n\nPositive examples:\n1. dolphin, pool\n2. dolphin, pool\n3. dolphin, pool\n4. dolphin, pool\n5. dolphin, pool at aquarium\n6. dolphins, aquarium\n\nAll positives have \"dolphin\" and either \"pool\" or \"aquarium\".\n\nNegative examples:\n1. cat, pool\n2. girl, pool\n3. seals, tank\n4. dolphins, pool (but man in background)\n5. dolphins, aquarium\n6. penguin, aquarium\n\nThe negative examples that have dolphins and pool/aquarium are negative 4, 5. So why are they negative? Because they don't have people? Or maybe the specific activity. \n\nBut positive 3 is dolphin in a pool without people and is positive. So maybe the pattern is just the presence of dolphins and the location (pool/aquarium), regardless of people. But then, the negative examples 4 and 5 would be positive, which contradicts the data. \n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me check again. The user says that the positive examples share a common pattern, and the negatives do not. So the correct approach is to find what is common in all positives and not present in any of the negatives.\n\nLooking at all positive sentences:\n\nThey all have \"dolphin\" and mention a location (pool or aquarium). \n\nNegative examples that include dolphins and location are:\n\nNegative 4: dolphins in a pool with a man in the background. \nNegative 5: dolphins in an aquarium. \n\nBut positive 3 is a dolphin in a pool and is positive. So why is negative 5 (dolphins in aquarium) negative? Maybe the key is that the positive examples have people interacting with dolphins in the location. Positive 3 is an exception. \n\nBut if some positive examples don't have people, then the pattern can't be people + dolphins + location. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the dolphins are in a pool or aquarium, and the sentence includes a human-related activity. For example, \"feeding\", \"in with\", \"swimming with\", \"watching\". \n\nPositive 3 is \"swimming in a pool\" \u2013 does that count as human-related? Maybe not. But it's still positive. \n\nThis is tricky. Let's try to find the pattern that all positives share and none of the negatives have. \n\nAll positives have \"dolphin\" and either \"pool\" or \"aquarium\". \n\nThe negatives that include dolphins and the location are:\n\nNegative 4: dolphins in a pool with a man in background.\nNegative 5: dolphins in aquarium.\n\nBut positive 3 is dolphin in a pool. So why is negative 5 negative? Maybe because it's just the dolphins in the aquarium without people or activity. \n\nBut positive 5 is \"dolphin swimming in the pool at the aquarium...\" which includes people watching. \n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that the sentence includes both \"dolphin\" and a location (pool/aquarium), and also mentions people interacting with them. But positive 3 is a dolphin in a pool without people and is positive. So that's a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the sentence mentions \"dolphin\" and either \"pool\" or \"aquarium\", and the presence of a human activity (like feeding, swimming with, watching). Positive 3 is \"dolphin swimming in a pool\" \u2013 the activity is swimming, but that's the dolphin's action. \n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find the pattern that all positives have and none of the negatives. \n\nAll positives include \"dolphin\" and a location (pool or aquarium). \n\nThe negatives that include dolphins and the location are negative 4, 5, and maybe 6 (but 6 has a penguin). \n\nSo if the pattern is simply the presence of \"dolphin\" and location (pool/aquarium), then negatives 4 and 5 would be positive, which they are not. \n\nTherefore, there must be another factor. \n\nLooking at the positives again, many of them have people interacting or present. For example, \"a woman feeding a dolphin\", \"a woman in a pool with a dolphin\", \"people watching dolphins\". Positive 3 is an exception. \n\nMaybe the pattern is that the sentence includes \"dolphin\" and a location (pool/aquarium), and either people are present or an activity involving people. \n\nBut how to reconcile with positive 3? \n\nPerhaps the key is that the sentence includes \"dolphin\" and the location, and the presence of people or an interaction involving people. Positive 3 is a dolphin in a pool, but the presence of the pool is enough? That seems inconsistent. \n\nAnother angle: the query is \"a woman holding an object in front of a dolphin\". It includes a woman and a dolphin, but no location. The pattern might be the presence of both a dolphin and a human in a specific location (pool/aquarium). \n\nBut in the positives, some have both, some don't. \n\nWait, positive 3 is dolphin in a pool (no human), but it's positive. Negative 5 is dolphins in an aquarium (no human), but it's negative. So why is positive 3 positive and negative 5 negative? \n\nThis suggests that there's another differentiator. Perhaps the presence of people is part of the pattern, but positive 3 is an exception. That doesn't make sense. \n\nMaybe the pattern is that the sentence mentions a dolphin in a controlled environment (pool/aquarium) and involves a human activity. For example, feeding, swimming with, watching, etc. Positive 3 is a dolphin swimming in a pool \u2013 the swimming is the dolphin's action, not a human activity. So why is it positive? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is the presence of a dolphin and a location (pool/aquarium), and the sentence is about an activity involving the dolphin in that location. \n\nThis is very unclear. Given the time I've spent, perhaps the correct approach is to look for the most consistent pattern. All positives have \"dolphin\" and a location (pool/aquarium). The negatives that have dolphins and location are negative 4 and 5. But positive 3 is an exception, which suggests that the pattern is not just that. \n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that the sentence includes \"dolphin\" and the location (pool/aquarium), and the location is specified as part of the activity. For example, \"swimming in the pool\", \"in with a woman\", etc. \n\nBut this is too vague. \n\nGiven that the user says the negatives do not share the pattern, perhaps the pattern is the presence of \"dolphin\" and \"pool\" or \"aquarium\". \n\nIf that's the case, then the query \"a woman holding an object in front of a dolphin\" doesn't mention pool or aquarium, so it would be negative. But I need to check if that's the case. \n\nBut the query is \"a woman holding an object in front of a dolphin\". It doesn't mention location, so according to this pattern, it wouldn't be positive. But if the pattern is that the sentence includes \"dolphin\" and a location, then the query doesn't fit. \n\nHowever, this contradicts the earlier analysis where some positives don't have people. \n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not correctly identified. \n\nAnother approach: look at the negatives and see what they lack. \n\nThe negatives that include dolphins and location are:\n\nNegative 4: dolphins in a pool with a man in background.\nNegative 5: dolphins in an aquarium.\n\nBut positive 3 is a dolphin in a pool and is positive. \n\nWhat's the difference between positive 3 and negative 4? Positive 3 is \"dolphin swimming in a pool\", while negative 4 is \"dolphins swimming in a pool with a man in the background\". \n\nMaybe the key is that in positive examples, the human is part of the main action with the dolphin, while in the negatives, the human is just in the background. \n\nBut this"

The negative examples are:\n\n1. \"the parise on the pizza\"\n2. \"a pizza topped with greens and topped with let rice\"\n3. \"a white bowl filled with carrot soup next to a pot...\" (mentions soup but also other things)\n4. \"a plate with broiled vegetables and a bowl of dips\"\n5. \"a glass jar filled with green smoothie next to fresh fruits and bananas\"\n6. \"a pan of broccotoo and broccotoos\"\n\nThe negatives either include non-vegetable items (like pizza, fruits) or have a different structure. The key might be that positives are all about vegetables or vegetable dishes, maybe with repetition of vegetable names. The fourth positive example has \"fen\" repeated multiple times, which might be a typo for \"fennel\" or similar. The negatives don't have this repetition of vegetable terms.\n\nNow, the query is: \"bro bro bro bro bro bro bro - bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro"

First, I need to figure out the common pattern among the positive sentences and then see if the query fits that pattern.\n\nLooking at the positive examples: they all mention some kind of bowl, plate, or spoon (like \"bowl\", \"plate\", \"spoon\") and they include peas, green peas, or other food items like rice, chops, black pepper. Also, phrases like \"stock image\" or \"isolated on white background\" appear. So the main elements are a container (bowl, plate) and food items, possibly peas, and they might be stock photos.\n\nNow the negative examples: they mention a green leaf, a pot of plant, a green bowl (but not food), apple on a plate (but maybe not in a bowl?), a person holding something unclear, rice and broccoli with utensils. The negatives don't have the combination of container and peas or similar food items in the same way. For example, \"apple on plate vector\" has a plate but not peas, and \"a pot of plant\" is a plant, not food in a container.\n\nThe query is \"green pea pea pea pea peas pea pea pea pea pea pea pea pea pea pea pea pea pea pea pea pea pea pea pea pea pea pea pea pea pea pea pea pea pea pea pea"

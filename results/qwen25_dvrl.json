None of these logos prominently feature the letter 'U' as a central design element. The logos are diverse and do not share the common 'U' theme seen in 'category_1'.\n\n- **Classification**: Based on the analysis, the query image should be classified as belonging to **category_2**. It does not share the defining characteristic of 'category_1' (prominent 'U' design) and instead aligns with the variety and lack of 'U' focus seen in 'category_2'."
